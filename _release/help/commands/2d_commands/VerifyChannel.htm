                This command verifies the integrity and validity of the channel variable. Returns True if the
                channel is valid and has not been released, or False if the channel is invalid or has been released.

                Note: This function does not check if the channel is playing. Once PlaySound or PlayMusic is called,
                the function will always return True until StopChannel is called. If you need to check if the channel
                is active playing, use the ChannelPlaying function.
