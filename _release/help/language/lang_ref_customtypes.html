			<h2>What Are They?</h2>
			<p><b>TYPE is your best friend.</b> It is used to create a 'collection' of objects 
				that share the same parameters and need to be interated through quickly and 
				easily.</p>
			<p>Think about SPACE INVADERS. There are many aliens on the screen at one time. 
				Each of these aliens have a few variables that they all need: x and y coordinates 
				plus a variable to control which graphic to display (legs out or legs in). 
				Now, we could make hundreds of variables like <code>invader1x, invader1y, invader2x, 
				invader2y</code>, etc. to control all the aliens, but that wouldn't make much sense 
				would it? You could use an array to track them; invader(number,x,y,graphic), 
				and the loop through them with a <code>FOR ... NEXT</code> loop but that is a lot of work! 
				The TYPE variable collection was created to handle just this sort of need.</p>
			<p>TYPE defines an object collection. Each object in that collection inherits 
				its own copy of the variables defined by the TYPE's FIELD command. Each variable 
				of each object in the collection can be read individually and can be easily 
				iterated through quickly. Use the FIELD command to assign the variables you 
				want between the TYPE and END TYPE commands.</p>
			<p>If it helps, think of a TYPE collection as a database. Each object is a record 
				of the database, and every variable is a field of the record. Using commands 
				like <code>BEFORE, AFTER</code>, and <code>FOR ... EACH</code>, you can move change the pointer of the 
				'database' to point to a different record and retrieve/set the variable <code>field</code> 
				values.</p>
			<p>Not a database guru? Need another example? Okay. Let's say you are setting 
				up an auditorium for a speech or event and you are putting up hundreds of 
				chairs for the spectators. The chairs have to be in a certain place on the 
				floor, and some will need to be raised up a bit higher than others (visiting 
				dignitaries, the mayor is coming, etc.). So being the computer genius you 
				are, you start figuring out how you can layout the chairs with the least amount 
				of effort. You realize that the floor is checkered, so its really a huge grid! 
				This will make it easy! You just need to number the floor on a piece of graph 
				paper and put into the grid how high each chair should be, based on where 
				the boss told you the important people are to sit. So, for each chair, you 
				will have a row and column on the graph paper (x and y location) and a level 
				to adjust the chair to (height). Good, we are organized. Now, even though 
				we have it all on paper, we still have to do the work of placing all the chairs. 
				After you are done, let's say your boss walks up to you and says &quot;they 
				aren't centered right .. move'em all over 1 square&quot;. Ah crap! You have 
				them all perfect, and even though it is a simple thing to move a chair one 
				square to the right (after all, their order and height won't change) - you 
				still have to move each and every chair! Should would be nice if you could 
				just wave your hand and say &quot;For each chair in the room, add 1 square 
				to its x location&quot; and have it just magically happen. Alas, in the real 
				world, get busy - you've got a lot of chairs to move!</p>
			<p>In Blitz, you could have set up a TYPE called CHAIR, set the TYPE's FIELDS 
				as X, Y, and HEIGHT. You would then create as many chairs as you need with 
				the NEW command (each time you call NEW, it makes a new chair, with its OWN 
				X, Y, and HEIGHT variables) and assign them the X, Y, and HEIGHT values you 
				decide upon. </p>
			<p>In our example above, when the boss told you to move the chairs over 1 box, 
				you probably groaned inside. That's a lot of work! In Blitz, we could use 
				four lines of code to adjust all our CHAIR objects to the new position (using 
				<code>FOR ... EACH</code> commands).</p>

			<h2>Defining A Type</h2>
			<p>Custom types are defined using the <code>Type</code> keyword. For example: </p>
			<blockquote>
				<code> 
					Type MyType <br>
					Field x,y <br>
					End Type
				</code> 
			</blockquote>
			<p> Creates a custom type called <code>MyType</code> with 2 fields - x and y.</p>
			<p> Fields within a custom type may themselves be of any basic type or custom type. Type tags are used to determine the type of a field. For example: </p>
			<blockquote> 
				<code> 
					Type MyType <br>
					Field x,y <br>
					Field description$ <br>
					Field delta_x#,delta_y# <br>
					End Type
				</code>
			</blockquote>

			<h2>Creating a Type Instance</h2>
			<p>You can create variables or arrays of custom types using a '.' type tag followed by the type name. For example: </p>
			<blockquote><code> Global mine.MyType Dim all_mine.MyType( 100 ) </code></blockquote>
			<p> Before a custom type variable or array element can be used, it must be initialized using the <code>New</code> operator. For example: </p>
			<blockquote><code> mine.MyType=New MyType</code></blockquote>
			<p> The <code>New</code> operator creates an 'object' of type <code>MyType</code>, and returns a 'pointer' 
				to the new object. The identifier following the <code>New</code> operator must be a valid 
				custom type name. </p>
			<p> The fields within a custom type are accessed using the '\' character. For 
				example:<code> mine\x=100 Print mine\x</code></p>

			<h2>Destroying a Type Instance</h2>
			<p>When you've finished with an object, you should delete it using the <code>Delete</code> command. For example: </p>
			<blockquote><code> Delete mine</code></blockquote>
			<p>This releases the memory used by the object. </p>

			<h2>Determining Existance</h2>
			<p>The special keyword <code>Null</code> is used to represent non-existent objects. An 
				object is non-existent if it hasn't been initialized yet using <code>New</code>, or has 
				been released using <code>Delete</code>. For example: </p>
			<blockquote> 
				<code>
					mine.MyType=New MyType <br>
					If mine<>Null <br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Print "exists!" <br>
					Else <br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Print "doesn't exist!" <br>
					EndIf <br>
					Delete mine <br>
					If mine<>Null <br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Print "exists!" <br>
					Else <br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Print "doesn't exist!" <br>
					EndIf
				</code>
			</blockquote>
			<p> ...will print the following:</p>
			<blockquote><output> exists! <br>doesn't exist!</output></blockquote>
			<p> Each custom type has an associated list of objects known as a 'type list'. 
				When an object is created using <code>New</code>, it is automatically added to the type 
				list. When an object is released using <code>Delete</code>, it is removed from the type 
				list. This list is dynamic - once an instance has been deleted, its place 
				in the collection is deleted and all the other objects after it will 'move 
				up' in the collection hiearchy.</p>

			<h2>Iteration Through Type Lists</h2>
			<p> The <code>First</code>, <code>Last</code>, <code>After</code> and <code>Before</code> operators allow you to access 
				type lists. The 'First' operator returns the object at the start of the type 
				list. For example: </p>
			<blockquote><code>mine.MyType=First MyType</code></blockquote>
			<p> This sets the <code>mine.MyType</code> variable to the first object of custom type 
				<code>MyType</code>. </p>
			<p> Similarly, 'Last' returns the object at the end of the list. </p>
			<p> If the type list is empty, 'First' and 'Last' return <code>Null</code>. </p>
			<p> You can use 'After' to find the object after an object, and 'Before' to find the object before an object. <br><br>For example: </p>
			<blockquote> 
				<code>mine.MyType=First MyType ;mine=first object in the type list <br>
					mine=After( mine ) ;mine=second object <br>
					mine=After( mine ) ;mine=third object <br>
					mine=Before( mine ) ;mine=second object <br>
					mine=Before( mine ) ;mine=first again! 
				</code>
			</blockquote>
			<p>'After' and 'Before' return <code>Null</code> if there is no such object. For example: </p>
			<blockquote><code>mine.MyType=Last MyType ;mine=last object <br>mine=After( mine ) ;object after last does not exist! </code></blockquote>
			<p>When an object is created using <code>New</code>, it is placed at the end of it's type 
				list by default. <br>
				However, You can move objects around within the type list using Insert. For 
				example: </p>
			<blockquote> 
				<code>mine1.MyType=New MyType<br>
					mine2.MyType=New MyType <br>
					Insert mine2 Before mine1 
				</code>
			</blockquote>
			<p> This has the effect of placing the 'mine2' object before the 'mine1' object 
				in the type list.<br>
				You can also use 'After' instead of 'Before' with Insert. </p>
			<p> Here's an example of moving an object to the start of it's type list: </p>
			<blockquote><p> <i>Insert mine Before First MyType </i></p></blockquote>
			<p> A special form of <b><code>For...Next</code></b> allows you to easily iterate over all 
				object of a custom type. For example: </p>
			<blockquote><code>For mine.MyType=Each MyType <br>Next </code></blockquote>
			<p>This will cause the variable <code>mine.MyType</code> to loop through all existing objects of cutom type MyType. </p>
			<p>Finally, the <code>Delete Each</code> command allows you to delete all objects of a particular type. For example: </p>
			<blockquote><code>Delete Each MyType </code></blockquote>
